**Movie Revenue Prediction (2000–2024)**  
A full-cycle analytics project that explores the relationship between movie metadata and box office performance, using real-world data from IMDb and Kaggle.

Built with R, this project combines **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **predictive modeling** to answer business-relevant questions such as:

- Which genres tend to generate the most revenue?
- Do directors, cast, or IMDb ratings significantly impact success?
- Can we predict a movie’s box office performance before its release?
- Does a higher IMDb rating actually mean higher revenue?

The project implements and compares several models:
-  **Logistic Regression** to classify hits (≥ $100M)
-  **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** for interpretability and accuracy
-  Evaluation using Accuracy, AUC, RMSE, and R²

With insights into creative industry trends and hands-on use of R's analytics ecosystem (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `randomForest`, `caret`), this repository showcases a complete business analytics workflow from data acquisition to model evaluation.

 Includes:
- Clean and organized `.R` scripts
- Visualizations and model outputs
- A formal academic-style report (PDF)
- Readable Markdown summaries

 Ideal for: data science portfolios, business analytics case studies, or movie data enthusiasts.
